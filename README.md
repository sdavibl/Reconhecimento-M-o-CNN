This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize and count the number of raised fingers in a given hand image. By utilizing deep learning techniques, the model extracts spatial features and patterns to accurately detect finger positions. The solution showcases practical applications of computer vision and machine learning in real-world image analysis tasks.
